# APZ_2023
My course work as 
a student of third course of 
Kharkiv national university of radioelectronic.
In this project I developed a system for providing discounts for peoples with right lifesytyle on services of insurance companies. 
Amount of discount depends on many factors which give us upportunity make some decossons about person's lifestyle.
Project consists of four parts: back-end, front-end, mobile application and smart device.
For back-end implementation I used .NET 6 with C# programming language. Also I used EnityFramework. For database was chosen MsSQL Server.
For front-end implementation I used React.js with botstrap. For adding ability of displaying site in several languages I used i18next library and axios library for sending http requests to back-end.
For mobile application implementation kotlin programming language was used. And for developing smart device I used Arduino-C for Arduino ESP-32 with built in WI-FI module.
